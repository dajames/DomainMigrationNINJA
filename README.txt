This is a script designed to move a Mac user account from the retiring UIUC domain to the new UOFI domain


READ ME!! FOR THE SAKE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY, READ ME!!  THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DESTRUCTIVE SCRIPT!!!


BEFORE YOU MOVE A PROFILE, YOU MUST DO THE FOLLOWING MANUALLY::

YOU MUST GO TO ï£¿ -> PREFERENCES -> USERS AND ACCOUNTS AND DELETE THE ACCOUNT YOU ARE MOVING!!!!

WHEN YOU DELETE THIS ACCOUNT, YOU MUST CHOOSE TO LEAVE FILES IN PLACE.  DO NOT DELETE FILES!  JUST THE ACCOUNT!  I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH!  IF YOU DELETE FILES, IT'S ALL OVER!

WHEN THE FILES ARE IN PLACE, THE ACCOUNT IS FOLLOWED BY A SPACE AND (Deleted) WHICH IS WHAT MY SCRIPT IS LOOKING FOR!

THE SPACE AND PARENTHESES CAUSE ALL KINDS OF HAVOC WITH TERMINAL COMMANDS, THEREFORE MY CODE BELOW IS PARTICULARLY LOOKING FOR IT!  IT WILL NOT WORK ANY OTHER WAY.


AFTER THE ACCOUNT HAS BEEN DELETED, YOU MUST THEN JOIN THE MAC TO THE UOFI DOMAIN.  ONCE THE MAC HAS BEEN JOINED TO THE UOFI DOMAIN, THE USER MUST THEN LOG IN AND CREATE A "BLANK" ACCOUNT WITH UOFI CREDENTIALS.  LOG OUT OF THAT ACCOUNT.

IN A NUTSHELL, THE SCRIPTS BELOW TAKE THE OLD ACCOUNT AND MASH IT INTO THE NEW UOFI ACCOUNT.
